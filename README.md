## Description

The Holy Moly Expert Advisor is a fully automated trading robot designed to trade the Forex market. It uses a simple trading strategy based on opening and closing positions with predefined stop loss and take profit levels.

The main features of the Holy Moly Expert Advisor include:

- Magic number to identify trades: The expert advisor uses the magic number 123456 to identify its own trades.
- Initial lot size: The expert advisor uses a lot size of 0.1 for opening positions.
- Stop loss and take profit levels: The expert advisor sets a stop loss of 50 pips and a take profit of 100 pips for each position.

## How It Works

The Holy Moly Expert Advisor works by continuously monitoring the market and making trading decisions based on predefined conditions.

1. OnTick(): This function is called on every tick (price change) in the market. It first checks if the current position is profitable. If it is, the position is closed with the predefined take profit level. If the position is not profitable or there is no position, the expert advisor checks if there is an opposite position. If there is, the opposite position is closed. Finally, if there is no position, a new position is opened with a buy order and the predefined stop loss level.

2. OnDeinit(): This function is called when the expert advisor is deinitialized. It closes all open positions to ensure no positions are left open.

3. OnTimer(): This function is called periodically based on a timer. It calculates the current equity of the trading account and checks if it is below 50% of the initial balance. If it is, all open positions are closed to limit losses.
